# API Catalog

The site [apisof.net] is exposing which .NET platform APIs exist, which packages
are needed to use them, whether they are obsolete, and which operating system
they are supported for.

## Missing

* Expose what's necessary to reference a given assembly (framework reference,
  SDK, and property)
* `typeof()` should use open generic syntax
